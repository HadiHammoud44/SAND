# Selection with Additive Noise Distortion

SAND is a feature selection algorithm for neural networks based on simple addition of a noise layer.

## Experiments
This project was built using `Python 3.9.2`

To download the datasets run `sh sand/experiments/get_all_data.sh`

To run the full experiments for `SAND`, run `python -m sand.experiments.experiment`.

**Note:** You can change the algorithm in the `experiment` file to run the experiments for other methods
